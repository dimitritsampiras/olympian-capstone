\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
  \subsubsection{The User Business or Background of the Project Effort}
  \noindent
  With the increase in media consumption across the world, there has been a greater focus on several previously underrepresented or inaccessable niches, such as health and fitness. Despite the growth and presence of fitness in social media, there are still large barriers to entry that make it intimidating to get started or get accurate information that would aid individuals in their fitness journeys. A lot of the media available online is either behind a paywall, or structured in undigestible video and written formats. The lack of a free, centralized system that contains media generated and verified by fitness enthusiasts alike spurred the idea for this application. This application aims to bridge the gap that exists in the online fitness world by allowing individuals to create and track workouts of their own, search and share workouts created by others, and review and discuss what they find personally works and doesn't work for them. Creating a collaborative online fitness environment allows individuals to start or expand their fitness journey without looking in numerous locations or paying money for programs that may not work for them. 
\subsection{Stakeholders}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Fitness Enthusiasts - Anyone interested in exploring other fitness routines, creating their own routines, and tracking their own personal progression towards goals.
	\item Personal Trainers - Olympian provides the ideal platform for trainers to share routines and goals with their clients.
	\item Fitness Advertisers - One avenue of monetization that Olympian could take is running advertisements. Although these advertisements could fall into any category, the largest stakeholders will be Fitness Advertisers,
	as the users of Olympian will be heavily involved with fitness, and thus most likely to buy fitness products.
	\item Dr. Smith and Course Teaching Assistants - Dr. Smith and the course TAs (Teaching Assistants) are invested in the application in terms of tracking its progress and completion along with its scope and complexity.
\end{enumerate}

%  has to map to a corresponding IM.}

\section{Nonfunctional Requirements}

%\plt{List your nonfunctional requirements.  You may consider using a fit
%  criterion to make them verifiable.}
%\plt{The goal is for the nonfunctional requirements to be unambiguous, abstract
%  and verifiable.  This isn't easy to show succinctly, so a good strategy may be
%to give a ``high level'' view of the requirement, but allow for the details to
%be covered in the Verification and Validation document.}
%\plt{An absolute requirement on a quality of the system is rarely needed.  For
%  instance, an accuracy of 0.0101 \% is likely fine, even if the requirement is
%  for 0.01 \% accuracy.  Therefore, the emphasis will often be more on
%  describing now well the quality is achieved, through experimentation, and
%  possibly theory, rather than meeting some bar that was defined a priori.}
%\plt{You do not need an entry for correctness in your NFRs.  The purpose of the
%  SRS is to record the requirements that need to be satisfied for correctness.
%  Any statement of correctness would just be redundant. Rather than discuss
%  correctness, you can characterize how far away from the correct (true)
%  solution you are allowed to be.  This is discussed under accuracy.}

		\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
			The product will be deployed to the Apple App store first, then it will be added to the Google Play store once it has run without issue on the app store.
			This project is new, so no transition period is relevant.
		\subsection{Risks}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item User data breach. If users' data is leaked, there would be damaging ramifications on our reputation and our userbase.
			\item Failure of content moderation. Olympian is a social media application and as such is susceptible to being used for nefarious and hateful purposes. This is why content moderation will be vital in running this application.
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Costs}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item The cost of keeping a server that is always responsive to client requests. This has an estimated cost of \$25 per month.
			\item The cost of utilizing a database that can handle many reads and writes quickly. This has an estimated cost of \$10 per month.
			\item The cost of an Individual Developer Account needed to host all apps on the Apple App Store. This will cost USD\$99.
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
			A user guide will be provided so that users are able to understand the intricacies of the application and how to navigate it.
		\subsection{Waiting Room}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item The product must allow users to track their diet information and recommend diets based on calory intake.
			\item The product must algorithmically produce a "Recommended" feed filled with workouts selected for users based on their habits and interests.
			\item The product must include an optional networking feature where users can view the growth of similar users and track the steps taken to produce those improvements.
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
			The product should be built using React Native along with an Express.js backend and utilizing the Google Firestore suite for app management including database and storage. Pricing was collected with these services in mind and they fullfil the needs of the product.
