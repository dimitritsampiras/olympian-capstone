	\section{Introduction}
	
	This document serves to illustrate and explain design decisions (in the context of alternatives) and the thought processes and considerations of the team that made said decisions.
	\section{Purpose}
	
	The purpose of this design documentation is to justify design decisions and prove that our final design meets all requirements as specified in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
	
	The purpose of this design documentation is to make clear current design choices, and to show why these designs were chosen over possible alternatives. This document also must prove that the current designs fulfill the requirements enumerated in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

	\section{Project Overview}
	
	\subsection{Normal Behaviour}
  
	Normal behaviour for the application can be defined as the state of the available program when all FRs and NFRs are fulfilled. If an FR or NFR is not fulfilled, this is abnormal behaviour, and indicative of the occurrence of an undesired event.
	
	\subsection{Undesired Event Handling}
	
	An `undesired event' can comprise anything from incorrect user input to database failure to connectivity issues. 
	
	\textbf{Invalid User Input}: Whenever a user provides incorrect information to a form (e.g. an invalid email address during sign-up), an informative error message is displayed beneath the incorrectly filled field, and a visual queue is given in the form of highlighting the field in red to indicate error. To prevent annoying the user with error messages before they have actually made an error, forms will only display error messages after the first submit attempt. After an initial submit attempt, the error message will remain until the contents of the field are valid. This is to give the user information as to whether or not their entry is valid before having to submit again.
	
	\textbf{Connection/Database Failure}: If the application is unable to connect to the internet, and subsequently the server and database, an informative error message is displayed, informing the user to verify their internet connection. Note that a stretch goal for the future is to have the Olympian application save certain information locally to enable the user to perform certain functions offline. Changed local information would be synced with the database once connection is re-established. However, this is a stretch goal, and current requirements and designs list the database as the only information store, no data (other than an authentication token) is stored locally. If the database/server itself is failing, an appropriate message is displayed to the user. The message will indicate that the failure is not the fault of the user, but rather an internal failure outside of their control.
	\\
	
	Error messages are kept consistent and concise in format, to make errors easy for the user to recognize and act upon.

\begin{tabular}{ | m{20em} | m{20em} | }
		\hline
		Requirement & Design \\
		\hline
		The product shall appear minimal and straightforward & The application will contain an interface that only presents information that is necessary as to prevent cluttering and reduce minimality \\
		\hline
		The product shall use fonts of readable size to the target user group & Fonts of size 10-12 will be used across the application \\
		\hline
		The product shall be able to be used by untrained fitness enthusiasts and amateurs alike, who receive no training before using it & UI will be simplistic and consistent throughout, reducing the learning curve for users \\
		\hline
		The product shall be usable by users with hearing loss or partial blindness & The application will rely on both audio and visual cues to indicate correct inputs or application events \\
		\hline
		The application must inform users when maintenance is taking place and must warn them at least 1 day in advance & The application will utilize pop up screens to display important notifications to the user \\
		\hline
		The applicaiton will allow users to report offensive content and remove it from their feed & There will be a button on each post that gives user the option to report offensive content \\

	Olympian will run on mobile devices (e.g. iPhone, Samsung Galaxy) not designed or manufactured by the team.
	
	\section{Design of Electrical Components}
	
	N/A - See Section 9.
	
	\section{Design of Communication Protocols}
	
	Communication between client and server will be done with HTTP requests.

	There is no custom communication protocol used.

	The project employs Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), enabling the client to communicate with the server and database through HTTP requests.
	
	\section{Reflection}
	
	The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
	graduate attribute of Problem Analysis and Design.  Please answer the following questions:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What are the limitations of your solution?  Put another way, given
		unlimited resources, what could you do to make the project better? (LO\_ProbSolutions)
		
		Limitations: require database to be populated (need users to create workouts and routines so other users can view and add)
		Given unlimited resources, having advertising or even starting users would help this problem of un-populated data.
		
		Another limitation would be that users cannot project their goals (extrapolation of their fitness goals).
		Given unlimited user data and statistics this could be predicted to help users estimate when they will reach their fitness goals
		
		\item Give a brief overview of other design solutions you considered.  What
		are the benefits and tradeoffs of those other designs compared with the chosen
		design?  From all the potential options, why did you select documented design?
		(LO\_Explores)
		
		Considering the software architecture, another alternative design for the flow of exercise, workout and routines that was considered was time-based. This means that each (workout, routine, exercise) would have a time and their sub-parts would schedule off a portion of the total duration.

		For our actual implementation, we decided to keep these as separate modules because creation is its own process and does not directly interface with the user module. By keeping these as separate processes, it helps exercise the idea of 'separation of concerns'.
		
		We decided not to use time-sectioning for the workouts / routines because it would cause limitations and be much more difficult to implement compared to having them as a sequence of events. If we wanted to collect the total duration of the workout / routine, a simple summation of parts would suffice.
