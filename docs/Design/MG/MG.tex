\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acDiscovery}:] The process by which users discover new content / other users.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acStyling}:] Visual styling and color design choices.
 \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acGoals}:] Connect goals feature up to database.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acMultimedia}:] Further multimedia options including custom profile pictures and the option to embed images and videos into workouts.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acQuantifiers}:] Track exercise progress with more metrics than just reps and sets. Include quantifiers such as time.
\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucLegal}:] Security requirements and legal compliance requirements are unlikely to be changed: NFR15, NFR16, NFR17, NFR18, NFR22.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucUsability}:] To maintain accessibility for all users, the following Usability and Humanity requirements are likely to remain unchanged: NFR2, NFR3, NFR4, NFR5, NFR6, NFR7.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucPerformance}:] The performance requirement specified by NFR8 encapsulates the mission of this application, which is to allow users to quickly update / interact with programs. As such, it is unlikely to change.
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table \ref{TblRT}.

\newpage

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{tabular}{ | m{20em} | m{20em} | } 
  \hline
  Requirement & Design \\
  \hline
  The product shall appear minimal and straightforward & The application will contain an interface that only presents information that is necessary as to prevent cluttering and reduce minimality \\
  \hline
  The product shall use fonts of readable size to the target user group & Only black and dark colored fonts will be used to display information. Font sizes of 12 and larger will be standard. All industry best practices for font style will be followed. \\
  \hline
  The product shall be able to be used by untrained fitness enthusiasts and amateurs alike, who receive no training before using it & UI will be simplistic and consistent throughout, reducing the learning curve for users \\
  \hline
  The product shall be usable by users with hearing loss or partial blindness & The application will rely on both audio and visual cues to indicate correct inputs or application events \\
  \hline
  The application must inform users when maintenance is taking place and must warn them at least 1 day in advance & The application will utilize pop up screens to display important notifications to the user \\
  \hline
  The applicaiton will allow users to report offensive content and remove it from their feed & There will be a button on each post that gives user the option to report offensive content \\
  \hline

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  \emph{\progname{}} means the
module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash
(\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have
to be implemented.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Q: What other designs were considered? \\
  a) Currently, the users and workout/routine creation are considered separate from each other but during one of the design meetings there was a conversion regarding creation being a user's action. This design involved the user module creating workouts and routines rather than having a separate interface.
  
  b) An alternative design for the flow of exercise, workout and routines that was considered was time-based. This means that each (workout, routine, exercise) would have a time and their sub-parts would schedule off a portion of the total duration.
  \item Q: Why was this one selected? \\ 
  a) As a group, we decided to keep these as separate modules because creation is its own process and does not directly interface with the user module. By keeping these as separate processes, it helps exercise the idea of 'separation of concerns'.
  
  b) We decided not to use time-sectioning for the workouts / routines because it would cause limitations and be much more difficult to implement compared to having them as a sequence of events. If we wanted to collect the total duration of the workout / routine, a simple summation of parts would suffice.
